#Tower Defense
==============

Tower Defense written in C++ using Lua as the scripting language for events.

This project is no longer worked on in favor of Augementum. 

Credit to the coders of [Intwars](https://github.com/Elyotna/IntWars) for how they do logging, I really liked it so I copied it into this. Because of this, TowerDef uses GPLv3 for its license.
